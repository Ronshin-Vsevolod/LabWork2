# General description of the system

## Main
    The system is a simplified parody of the turn-based indie game shogun showdown.
    This includes game core development: character and ability hierarchy based on class inheritance; simple AI; graphical interface.


## Basic mechanics, terminology:
    The main part of the system, the company game mode, consists of levels made up of "battle stages" and "purshare stages".Game characters possess a ‘skills_stack’, from where the ‘skills’ go to the ‘prepare_stack’ and only then are cast."skulls" are the currency for the shop on the menu.
